# Responsive Landing Page

This project is a responsive landing page built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It consists of three pages: a landing page, a sign-in page, and a sign-up page.

## Pages

- **Landing Page**: This page serves as the main entry point for users. It provides an overview of the product or service and encourages users to explore further.
- **Sign In Page**: Users can sign in to their accounts using this page. It typically includes input fields for username/email and password.
- **Sign Up Page**: New users can create an account using this page. It usually includes input fields for username/email, password, and sometimes additional information like name, age, etc.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for the structure and content of the web pages.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling the components and achieving responsiveness.
- JavaScript: (If applicable) Used for any interactive elements or dynamic content.
